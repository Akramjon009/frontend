            Git is a distributed version control system that is commonly used for managing and tracking changes to source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and has since become one of the most popular version control systems in use.
            Git allows developers to work on projects simultaneously, tracking changes made by each contributor and enabling collaboration.It provides features such as branching (creating separate lines of development),
            merging (combining changes from different branches), and versioning (keeping track of all changes made to the codebase over time).
            GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built around Git. It provides hosting for Git repositories and offers additional features for collaboration, such as issue tracking, pull requests, code review tools,
            and project management features. GitHub has become a central hub for many open-source projects and is widely used by both individual developers and organizations to share, collaborate on, and contribute to software projects.
            In summary, Git is the version control system itself, while GitHub is a platform built around Git that provides hosting and collaboration tools for managing Git repositories.
